Welcome to our technical development test. 

👨‍💻 We expect from you your creativity and innovation, so do not be ashamed to "code express yourself". 👩‍💻

If you can, we will love to see some front-end code (UI), but this is not our priority to evaluate you on that. ✌️

------------

### 🤩 Are you an anime lover?

If your answer was a huge **YES** or not, we promise you will like to do this tech test.

We will use the [ANIAPI](https://aniapi.com/ "ANIAPI") 
> an open-source REST API for anime streaming lovers. (official website api description)

------------

### What you need to do?

Consume the anime ANIAPI and develop your own NodeJs REST API with express.

Easy, right?

5. Use audio previews;
6. Search for a specific anime and store the search history for a future use;


and so forth...
